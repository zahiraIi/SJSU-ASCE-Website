## For Website Administrators

This section provides instructions for non-technical users who need to update content on the website.

### Updating Photos

The website uses Cloudflare R2 Cloud Storage for storing and serving images. To update photos:

#### Option 1: Through the Cloudflare R2 Web Interface (Recommended for non-technical users)

1. **Log in to the Cloudflare R2 account**:
   - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
   - Use the ASCE account credentials (contact the webmaster if you don't have access)

2. **Navigate to the bucket**:
   - Click on "R2" in the left sidebar
   - Select the "ascewebsiteimages" bucket

3. **Upload new images**:
   - Click the "Upload" button
   - Select files from your computer
   - Maintain the folder structure when uploading:
     - Event photos go in: `FGM Pics/` or appropriate event folder
     - Officer photos go in: `officers/`
     - General photos go in: `photos/`

4. **Important notes**:
   - Image files should be in JPG or PNG format
   - Keep filenames simple without special characters
   - Optimize images before uploading (aim for less than 1MB per image)
   - Images will appear on the website shortly after uploading

### Managing the Calendar

The website displays events from a Google Calendar. To update events:

1. **Access the Google Calendar**:
   - Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
   - Sign in with the SJSU ASCE account credentials

2. **Add or edit events**:
   - Click on the date for a new event, or click an existing event to edit
   - Fill in the event details:
     - Title: Clear, concise name of the event
     - Date and time: When the event will occur
     - Location: Physical location or Zoom link
     - Description: Add details about the event

3. **Categorize your event** (important for website display):
   - In the event description, add a line: `Category: [CATEGORY_NAME]`
   - Example: `Category: Workshops & Training`
   - Available categories:
     - Workshops & Training
     - Competitions
     - Networking Events
     - General

4. **Add an image** (optional):
   - In the event description, add a line: `ImagePath: path/to/image.jpg`
   - Example: `ImagePath: events/workshop_spring_2023.jpg`
   - Make sure the image is uploaded to Cloudflare R2 first

5. **Changes will be reflected on the website automatically** (might take a few minutes)

### Contact Form Information

When visitors submit the contact form, their information is stored in a database. To access this information:

1. **Check the contact submissions**:
   - Contact form submissions are forwarded to the SJSU ASCE email account
   - Sign in to your ASCE Gmail account to view submissions
   - Submissions will have the subject line "New Contact Form Submission"

2. **Export submissions** (if needed):
   - For a record of all submissions, contact the website administrator
   - Data can be exported to Excel/CSV format upon request
